### Install Sagemath

If you have the opportunity, it's recommended to install Sagemath on
your personal machine. Instructions at
<https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html>.

### Use Sagemath in the cloud

If you couldn't install Sagemath, you can use the service above to run
it in the cloud for free.

#### Cocalc

[Cocalc](https://cocalc.com/) is a freemium cloud service providing
Sagemath and other scientific tools.  You will have to create an
account in order to use it.

You can open the tutorials in Cocalc by following this link:
<https://cocalc.com/github/defeo/cimpa-popayan>.

After you open a notebook, click on "Edit your own copy". It will
prompt you to create an account, if you haven't already done so, and
then import the notebook in a project.
